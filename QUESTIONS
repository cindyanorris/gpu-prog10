Be sure your code has been compiled with the optimizations turned
on before answering question 6.

Give your answers to 1 - 5 as powers of 2.

1) How many blocks are created by the sweep kernel launch
when the code is executed with 26 for the -s parameter?


2) What is the total number of warps (all blocks) for the sweep
kernel when the code is executed with 26 for the -s parameter?


3) How many blocks are created by the sum kernel launch
when the code is executed with 26 for the -s parameter?


4) What is the total number of warps (all blocks) for the sum
kernel when the code is executed with 26 for the -s parameter and
1 for the -n parameter?


5) What is the total number of warps (all blocks) for the sum
kernel when the code is executed with 26 for the -s parameter and
16 for the -n parameter?


6) Show the output of your program using 26 for the -s parameter
and 4, 8, 16, and 32 for -n.


7) What are the tradeoffs between having lots of warps where each thread in
the warp does a small amount of work and fewer warps where each thread in
the warp does a larger amount of work.
